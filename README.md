# Envy.

Envy is an opinionated tool to manage venv and pip. It's designed for python applications that want:

- A per project venv
- Deterministic installs
- A drop in replacement for pip

## How to use it

### I'm starting a new project and want a venv

Run `envy`

### I'm checking out someone else's project and want to install dependencies

Run `envy`

### I've checked out a new commit and want to make sure my dependencies are up to date

Run `envy`

### I want to install a dependency

Run `envy install`, for example:
`envy install pandas`

That's all! `envy` will manage your venv, `requirements.txt` and `requirements.base.txt`.

# Under the hood

There are 3 artefacts maintained by envy:

- `requirements.base.txt` - a list of base requirements for the application. When you `envy install`, the installed packages get added here.
- `requirements.txt` - a lockfile generated by `pip freeze` after installing base requirements. This contains every package including subdependencies, all pinned to specific versions.
- `.venv` - the virtual environment, containing installed packages
